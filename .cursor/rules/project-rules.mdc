- All our new Zod schemas should go in the /schemas folder
- All services should go in the /services folder
- All utils should be in the /utils fodler

- Always maintain consistency with our project implementation (you can check our implementaion to see similarities before implementing a new feature)

- For example, if you need a date time picker, first check how we implemented similar thing in other pages/components

- Same goes for api, services, utils, lib, types, and etc
