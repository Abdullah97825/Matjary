Order status and their transitions:
* Pending: this status occurs when the customer submits an order that has no special pricing items (hidden or negotiable price). This is how actors can update the status:


1. Admin:
   1. Can reject the order (new status: rejected)
   2. Can accept the order (new status: accepted)
   3. Can edit the order items and send the quote back to customer (new status: customer_pending)


2. Customer: cannot do anything and can simply wait for new status


* Admin_pending: this status occurs when the customer requests details on an order that has items with special pricing (hidden or negotiable price)
1. Admin:
   1. Can reject the order (new status: rejected)
